# Predicting Thyroid Cancer Risk: A Data Science Case Study

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict thyroid cancer risk levels (Low, Medium, High) based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle data collected over a 15-year period. The goal is to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from closer monitoring and to uncover the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer risk.

The project follows the **CRISP-DM framework**, including:
- Data Collection and Understanding
- Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Modeling and Evaluation
- Interpretability and Feature Importance Analysis
- Business Question Review

## Key Findings
- **Top Contributing Factors**: Nodule Size, TSH Level, Radiation Exposure
- **Model Performance**: Best model (Tuned Random Forest) achieved 66.86% accuracy.
- **Interpretability**: SHAP analysis highlighted clinical factors as primary risk indicators.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and obesity contributed minimally compared to clinical data.
